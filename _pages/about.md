Hi! I am Sid. In my free time you will find me listening to Classical Rock music, watching sitcoms or trying to find excuses to quote silly puns and Star Wars references. As a kid, I was fascinated by how Artificial Intelligence got potrayed in sci-fi movies and novels. Which is one of the main reasons how I got introduced to this field.

Currently I am doing research in Predictive Modelling (using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Probabilistic Programming) 
and its applications to areas such as (but not limited to) Computational Materials Science, Business Analytics, Enviromental Sciences and Human Well Being.
